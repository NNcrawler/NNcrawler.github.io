One of the reasons is because programming activity requires you to hold lots of information in your head. You need to think about the structure, algorithm, edge cases, etc. It puts pressure on the cognitive load.</p>\n<p>To make changes to an existing codebase, you need to understand the current codebase. You need to read it. When you read code, most of the time, you’ll need to navigate through files and read the code. What I found was, this activity is tiring and requires a lot of cognitive loads. You need to browse the files, you need to find references of where the class or function is defined. Doing this manually is tiring.</p>\n<p>One way you can decrease the cognitive load is by utilizing keyboard shortcuts. By using shortcuts, you shed some load because it becomes automatic. You don’t need to think about it. I found that mastering shortcuts and make it a habit make programming easier and time-efficient.</p>\n<p>I use VSCode as my main editor. Some shortcuts that been helping me are:</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">cmd + p</code> jump between files</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">cmd + P -&gt; p</code> jump to previous files</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">ctrl + -</code> jump to previous point</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">ctrl + shift + -</code> reverse <code class=\"language-text\">ctrl + -</code></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"How Navigation Helps Me To Keep Focus","date":"February 12, 2021","description":null,"tags":["programming"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/how-navigation-helps-me-to-keep-focus/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/game-covid-dan-masa-depan/"},"frontmatter":{"template":"post","title":"Sebuah Pelajaran: Game, Covid19, dan Masa Depan","tags":["life","principle"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/zombie-appocalypse/"},"frontmatter":{"template":"post","title":"Zombie Appocalypse?","tags":["story"]}}}}}
